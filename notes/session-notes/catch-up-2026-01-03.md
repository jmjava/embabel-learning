**Your Local Status:**
- ⚠️ **1 unpushed commit:** "updating for Friday morning session"
  - **Content:** Updated pom.xml version from 0.1.0-SNAPSHOT to 0.3.1-SNAPSHOT
  - **Note:** This change is likely already in upstream (they upgraded to 0.3.1)
- ⚠️ **5 upstream commits** you don't have locally
- **Action needed:** Sync with upstream (see below)

## 🚨 Action Items

### 1. Sync guide Repository (URGENT)

Your guide fork has diverged from upstream:

```bash
cd ~/github/jmjava/guide
git status  # Shows: "Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged"

# Option 1: Review your local commit first
git log HEAD~1..HEAD  # See what "updating for Friday morning session" contains

# Option 2: Sync with upstream (recommended)
cd ~/github/jmjava/embabel-learning
esync guide  # Or: ./scripts/sync-upstream.sh guide
```

**Decision needed:** 
- Your local commit updates pom.xml version to 0.3.1-SNAPSHOT
- This is likely already done upstream (they upgraded to 0.3.1)
- **Recommended:** Sync with upstream - the version change is already there
- If you want to be safe, review upstream first: `git log upstream/main -- pom.xml | head -20`

### 2. Review New PRs

Take a look at the new PRs in embabel-agent:

```bash
epr agent 1223  # Action retry with annotations
epr agent 1219  # Thinking blocks support
epr agent 1177  # OpenAI compatibility discussion
```

### 3. Update Contribution Tracking

Your contribution summary needs updating:

```bash
cd ~/github/jmjava/embabel-learning
emy --all  # Regenerate contribution reports
```

This will create:
- Updated `notes/my-contributions/SUMMARY.md`
- `notes/my-contributions/embabel-agent_PR1193.md` (if not already exists)

### 4. Explore Recent Changes

Check out what's new in the codebase:

```bash
# See recent commits in guide
cd ~/github/jmjava/guide
git log upstream/main --oneline -10

# See recent commits in embabel-agent
cd ~/github/jmjava/embabel-agent
git log upstream/main --oneline -10
```

## 📚 Learning Opportunities

### 1. Domain Conversion to Kotlin (guide)

The guide repo recently converted domain classes to Kotlin. This is a great learning opportunity:

```bash
cd ~/github/jmjava/guide
git log upstream/main --oneline --grep="Kotlin" -5
git show <commit-hash>  # See the conversion changes
```

**Why this matters:** Understanding how Java code is converted to Kotlin, especially for DSL usage with Drivine.

This is a new feature being added. Great opportunity to:
- See how new features are implemented
- Understand the PR review process
- Learn about the codebase structure
