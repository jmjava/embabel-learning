# Configuration Template for embabel-learning scripts
# Copy this file to .env and customize it for your environment

# Your personal GitHub username. Used for forking, cloning, and identifying your contributions.
# This is YOUR username (e.g., "alice", "bob", "your-username")
# Your forks will be at: github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/repo-name
#
# Note: This is your personal username, NOT your organization name.
# If you have a personal org (e.g., "menkelabs"), that's separate from YOUR_GITHUB_USER.
YOUR_GITHUB_USER=your-username

# The GitHub organization whose repositories you want to MONITOR and learn from.
# This is for PRODUCTION use - the organization you want to monitor.
# Examples: "embabel", "spring-projects", "apache", "kubernetes", etc.
# The scripts will monitor this organization's repos, not YOUR organization's repos.
UPSTREAM_ORG=embabel

# Optional: GitHub organization to use for TESTING only.
# If set, test scripts will use this instead of UPSTREAM_ORG.
# This is safer for testing since it uses your own organization.
# Leave empty or unset to use UPSTREAM_ORG for tests as well.
# Example: TEST_UPSTREAM_ORG=menkelabs
TEST_UPSTREAM_ORG=

# The base directory where your GitHub repositories are cloned.
# Default: $HOME/github/${YOUR_GITHUB_USER}
BASE_DIR=$HOME/github/${YOUR_GITHUB_USER}

# A space-separated list of repository names to monitor daily.
# These should be repos you have cloned under $BASE_DIR.
# Example: MONITOR_REPOS="guide embabel-agent dice"
MONITOR_REPOS=guide embabel-agent

# Workspace name for VS Code/Cursor workspace file
WORKSPACE_NAME=${UPSTREAM_ORG}-workspace

# Maximum number of repos to auto-detect if MONITOR_REPOS is not set
MAX_MONITOR_REPOS=10

# Discord Integration
# Your Discord bot token or user token for exporting messages from Discord channels.
# Required for discord-sync/sync-discord.sh to work.
#
# How to get a token:
#   - Bot token: https://discord.com/developers/applications (create a bot, copy token)
#   - User token: Use browser DevTools (not recommended for production)
#
# Security notes:
#   - Never commit your token to git (this file is in .gitignore)
#   - Use bot tokens when possible (more secure than user tokens)
#   - Limit token permissions to only what's needed
#   - Rotate tokens if compromised
#
# See discord-sync/README.md for more information.
DISCORD_TOKEN=your-discord-token-here

# Optional: Default Discord channel ID
# Can be overridden with --channel flag when running sync-discord.sh
# DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678
